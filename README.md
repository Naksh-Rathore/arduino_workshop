## Overview
Have you ever wanted to build cool stuff, but realized it was too hard! Me too, especially the programming side! That's why I decided to help me and everyone else out by making this **Arduino Workshop**!<br />
This repository is a collection of simple Arduino projects, perfect to teach **beginners** and great if you want to **practice** your Arduino skills without making a big project.<br />
This includes many short examples about different components to get you started building, to learn by doing! Each example contains the `.ino` **code** and a **schematic** so you can do this project too.
